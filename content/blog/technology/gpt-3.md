## 6 reasons why GPT-3 is shockingly amazing!

OpenAI has very recently described GPT-3, new generative language model that is bigger than GPT-2 by orders of magnitude and - a deep-learning model for NLP with over 175 billion parameters. The model is pre-trained on nearly half a trillion words and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP benchmarks without fine-tuning.

In paper published on arXiv, a team of over 30 co-authors described the model and several experiments. The researchers' goal was to produce an NLP system that performs well on a variety of tasks with little or no fine-tuning, and previous work had indicated that larger models might be the solution.

To test that hypothesis, the team increased the model size from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion. The datasets were collected from Common Crawl and the English-language Wikipedia.

GPT-3 has been a massive buzz recently and to testify what this buzz is all about we are going to look at 10 really interestingly shocking ways GPT-3 can revolutionise AI in no time.

## 1. Mock-up Websites

Developer Jordan Singer used GPT-3 × Figma plugin that recieves a URL and a description of a website. Something as simple as typing in plain English, ‘an apple.com like website for Twitter’, would result in the following:

    <source src="assets/videos/1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="assets/videos/1.mp4" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="assets/videos/1.mp4" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>

## 2. ML Code

Matt Schumer, CEO of OthersideAI, has used GPT-3 to generate code for a machine learning model, just by describing the dataset and required output.

    <source src="assets/videos/2.mp4" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>

## 3. Layout Generator

Sharif Shameem has leveraged GPT-3 to generate code. All he had to do was write a couple of samples to give some context to GPT-3.

Shareen tweeted that If he wanted to write output plain HTML/CSS instead of JSX, all he would have to do would be to rewrite the two initial samples in HTML/CSS. Then all of GPT-3’s outputs would be in plain HTML/CSS.

## 4. JavaScript API

Antonio Gomez, a senior engineer at Apple, used GPT-3 to produce generative code snippets of the JavaScript API by textually describing the elements and their parameters needed to create a WebGL 3D scene.

## 5. Search Engines

Paras Chopra, the founder of Wingify, used GPT-3 to create a search engine ‘Ask me anything’, that functions smoothly as shown in the demo above.

## 6. Understand Code

Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, built an application where one can type queries about the code on the go and learn information about the functionality of each item in the code.
